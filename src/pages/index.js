    <p> 
      I'm a full-time software engineer at Greenhouse.io, where I build features in Ruby on Rails and React. 

      With a strong background in automated testing, I value writing code that is well-tested, coherent, and maintainable. 

      Outside of coding, I'm a lifelong competitive runner, and a photographer of sports and music events.
